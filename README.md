# Stocks Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project, I edited, or refactored, the solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect stock data to examine the entire stock market for 2017 and 2018. Then, I determined whether refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster. 
## Results

## Summary

- **What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**
Refactoring code is used to restructure the existing body of code by altering its internal structure of the code, but it doesn't change the behavior of the code.*https://refactoring.com/*

	- Advantages
		- helps to optimize code so that future implimentations of improvements or features are easier to take place
		- Since code is refined and optimized it is easier to find and fix bugs
		- Reviewing and understanding code is easier since the code is see

	- Disadvantages
		- Is time consuming if you are working with large code. As a result one should not attempt to refactor code if they have a deadline approaching. 
		- If not careful you can actually introduce bugs during refactoring
		- It is expensive and risky in the view of management. *https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/pros-and-cons-of-code-refactoring/*
	
- **How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script*
	- Refactoring the original VBA script made it more efficient. Since it was a small code sample the refactoring took minimal time. In the end the advantages out weighed the disadvantages since it was a fairly quick and easy project.
